Alternatively you can mix all contents into a jar seal it and shake until evenly mixed.\nIn an air-tight plastic container pour about 1inch thick of of the curing mix, and gently lay the duck breast (skin side up) ontop of it. ,Make sure the breast doesn't touch the sides of the container.\nPour the remaining mix ontop of the breast, completely covering it and filling the container (make more if there is not enough to fill the container).\nPlace the sealed container in the fridge and leave for 1 to 2 days.\nThe salt is now curing the meat and drawing the moisture out of the duck breast. Thus preserving the meat and enabling it for human consumtion without cooking, just like italian proscuitto. The sugar imparts a slight sweet flavour onto the meet to offset the saltiness.\nAfter 1 to 2 days remove the container from the fridge and remove the duck breast from the cure mix.\nQuickly wash off the excess mix with water, but don't keep it under the water for too long.\nPat the cured breast dry and wrap tightly with a clean muslin, cheese, or thick cloth. Suspend the duck from a string in a dry, warm area for 5 to 7 days to thoroughly dry the duck out.\nAlternatively at this stage the breast can be thinnly sliced and pan fried as a duck version of pork bacon.\nAfter 5 to 7 days the duck is ready to be thinnly sliced like normal proscuitto and used in salads, pastas, or served as part of a meat & cheese platter. Enjoy and watch your friends' reactions when you tell them you cured the proscuitto yourself!\nTo store, keep duck refridgerated and wrapped in clingfilm.\nFlavour Variations: To impart other suttle flavours into the meat feel free to add dried herbs and spices to the curing mix before curing. Dried orange peel, dried cranberries, and pink peppercorns work nicely with duck breast.

(Shortbread will not be crisp until cool.).\nLess easy method: Chill dough.

Food-grade lavender is usually available in herb bins at health food stores, and I recently found it at a great price from Atlantic Spice online (their Lavender #1).\nVariation: After cutting shortbread into squares (it will still be warm), scatter 1 cup of chocolate chips over the top, let the chocolate soften completely, then spread as a thin layer and let cool completely before removing from pan.  (No need to sprinkle shortbread with sugar before baking if you plan to do this.).\nVariation: Stir 1 cup chocolate chips or butterscotch chips into the dough before pressing into pan. You can also try melting the butterscotch over the top, as above. In England, you'll find \"caramel shortbread,\" which has a layer of caramel and a layer of chocolate on top of the shortbread.
