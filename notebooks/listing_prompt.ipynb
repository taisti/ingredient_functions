Scrape into prepared pan; then cover with a sheet of parchment paper. Press down firmly to make an even, compact layer (just don’t press too hard or you’ll break the loops!).

Alternatively you can mix all contents into a jar seal it and shake until evenly mixed.\\nIn an air-tight plastic container pour about 1inch thick of of the curing mix, and gently lay the duck breast (skin side up) ontop of it. ,Make sure the breast doesn't touch the sides of the container.\\nPour the remaining mix ontop of the breast, completely covering it and filling the container (make more if there is not enough to fill the container).\\nPlace the sealed container in the fridge and leave for 1 to 2 days.\\nThe salt is now curing the meat and drawing the moisture out of the duck breast. Thus preserving the meat and enabling it for human consumtion without cooking, just like italian proscuitto. The sugar imparts a slight sweet flavour onto the meet to offset the saltiness.\\nAfter 1 to 2 days remove the container from the fridge and remove the duck breast from the cure mix.\\nQuickly wash off the excess mix with water, but don't keep it under the water for too long.\\nPat the cured breast dry and wrap tightly with a clean muslin, cheese, or thick cloth. Suspend the duck from a string in a dry, warm area for 5 to 7 days to thoroughly dry the duck out.\\nAlternatively at this stage the breast can be thinnly sliced and pan fried as a duck version of pork bacon.\\nAfter 5 to 7 days the duck is ready to be thinnly sliced like normal proscuitto and used in salads, pastas, or served as part of a meat & cheese platter. Enjoy and watch your friends' reactions when you tell them you cured the proscuitto yourself!\\nTo store, keep duck refridgerated and wrapped in clingfilm.\\nFlavour Variations: To impart other suttle flavours into the meat feel free to add dried herbs and spices to the curing mix before curing. Dried orange peel, dried cranberries, and pink peppercorns work nicely with duck breast. The overall curing mix should always work on a 3 parts salt to 1 part everything else.\",\n",

       "  'instructions': \"Take your block of tofu and wrap it in several layers of paper towels.\\nGently press the tofu with your hands or against the counter top to release the liquid. This will take about a minute.\\nSlice the tofu into pieces about 1/2 an inch thick.\\nSet tofu aside.\\nIf you are using a non-stick pan heat it slightly on medium-high heat (about 30 seconds) before adding oil.\\nIf you are using a cast iron pan, please heat for about 1 minute to 1 1/2 minutes on medium-high heat. Cast iron is very thick and you want the pan to be heated evenly before adding the tofu.\\nAdd oil to heated pan.\\nGently spread oil over the entire surface of the pan.\\nSet the tofu pieces in the pan, leaving ample room between them.  They should sizzle when placed in the oil.  Sprinkle the tops with salt and a little cayenne pepper.\\nNow, the MOST IMPORTANT step is -- LEAVE THEM ALONE for about 6 or 7 minutes.  Just gently shake them to make sure they don't stick to the pan.  Do NOT turn them or agitate them in any other way.  When you see a golden crust beginning to creep its way up the sides of the slices, turn them and spice the other side.  Add more oil if the pan seems too dry.\\nThe second side will only take about 4 minutes to cook.\\nWhen they are evenly browned take them out of the pan and place them on paper towels to drain.\\nThese are very simply seasoned and basic and can now be used any way you like.  I like these with steamed broccoli and peanut sauce -- or in a sandwich with grilled peppers and mushrooms and aioli -- or just eaten with ketchup:-).\",\n",

(Shortbread will not be crisp until cool.).\\nLess easy method: Chill dough. Roll into 1-inch balls, then press balls to about 1/4-inch thickness on ungreased cookie sheets with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar (sometimes you can find a glass with a pretty design on the bottom, like a star).

Bake on ungreased cookie sheets at 300° for about 20-25 minutes (until edges are very lightly browned).\\nVariation: Add 2 tablespoons dried lavender to the creamed butter and sugar before adding flour. It may sound strange, but the flavor is subtle and elegant.  Food-grade lavender is usually available in herb bins at health food stores, and I recently found it at a great price from Atlantic Spice online (their Lavender #1).\\nVariation: After cutting shortbread into squares (it will still be warm), scatter 1 cup of chocolate chips over the top, let the chocolate soften completely, then spread as a thin layer and let cool completely before removing from pan.  (No need to sprinkle shortbread with sugar before baking if you plan to do this.).\\nVariation: Stir 1 cup chocolate chips or butterscotch chips into the dough before pressing into pan. You can also try melting the butterscotch over the top, as above. In England, you\\'ll find \"caramel shortbread,\" which has a layer of caramel and a layer of chocolate on top of the shortbread. It\\'s wonderful (of course!). I\\'ve tried various ways of doing this and various kinds of caramel, but it\\'s been a while and I don\\'t remember what works best.
